# OiRA Statistics

Welcome to the OiRA statistics!

Here are a few hints and explanations to help you find what you're looking for.

## Terminology

-   **Accumulated** - Whenever this term is used, we have summed up
    numbers from the beginning of our records to the given date. E.g. “Number of
    assessments” for March 2020 is the number of assessments that have been started in
    March 2020, while “Accumulated assessments” for March 2020 is the number of
    assessments that have been started between the beginning of records and the end of
    March 2020. By using the filter options you can also change this time span to any
    period you are interested in, e.g. a specific year.
-   **Assessment**- A set of answers, actions and other items related to one particular
    use of a certain OiRA tool. Assessment refers to the different risk assessments a
    user has conducted with a tool. One user can do several risk assessments with the
    same or different tools.
-   **Card** - The representation of a Question on a Dashboard.
-   **Collection** - You can think of collections like folders that contain Dashboards,
    Questions and other statistics items.
-   **Converted User or Converted Account** - A user who started as a guest and
    subsequently registered an account from within a guest assessment.
-   **Dashboard** - Dashboards allow viewing a set of Questions together. They will be
    displayed as cards on the dashboard.
-   **Guest User** - A temporary user who has started an assessment without first
    registering a full user account. Please note: due to many automated requests the
    guest user count does not actually reflect real people going to the tools before May
    2021, when a feature went live to prevent these machine generated test sessions.
-   **Question** - A Question shows an aspect of the statistical data. The term refers
    to a query, the results of that query, and the visualization and formatting of those
    results (which could be a line graph, a pie chart or just a table of results).
    Questions can be displayed as Cards on Dashboards.
-   **Registered User** - refers to all users having an account in OiRA. This
    includes *converted users* and users who registered from the start, without first
    starting an assessment as a guest.
-   **Top Assessment** - An assessment in which more than 70% of risks have been
    answered.

## Available Dashboards

Data for each country is shown in 3 different dashboards:

1. **Users dashboard**: Shows all data in relation to users (registered users and guest
   users)
2. **Assessments dashboard:** Shows data in relation to the assessments done with the
   tools in one country, such as new assessments per month, accumulated assessments,
   qualitative indicators (how many of the questions in a tool have been answered) as
   well as the number of assessments by tool. Remember to use the filter options if you
   want to have more detailed information about a tool (e.g. for accumulated assessments
   per month you can filter by tool/sector and by completion percentage). Filter options
   are also useful if you have many tools published and the “tools by accumulated
   assessments overview” doesn´t show you all tools in the table.
3. **Questionnaire dashboard:** Gives information about the answers to the voluntary
   questionnaire in the OiRA tool. This includes e.g. number of employees in the
   company, needs were met by the tool, etc. From April 2021 on this data can be
   filtered for certain time periods. Before April 2021 this information is not
   available.
