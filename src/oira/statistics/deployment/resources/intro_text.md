# OiRA Statistics

Welcome to the OiRA statistics!

Here are a few hints and explanations to help you find what you're looking for.

## Terminology

* *Accumulated* - Whenever this term is used, we have summed up numbers from the beginning of our records to the given date. E.g. "Number of assessments" for March 2020 is the number of assessments that have been started in March 2020, while "Accumulated assessments" for March 2020 is the number of assessments that have been started between the beginning of records and the end of March 2020.
* *Assessment* - A set of answers, actions and other items related to one particular use of a certain OiRA tool.
* *Converted User* or *Converted Account* - A user who started as a guest and subsequently registered an account from within a guest assessment.
* *Guest User* - A temporary user who has started an assessment without first registering a full user account.
* *Registered User* - A non-guest user. This includes *converted users* (see there) and users who registered without first starting an assessment as a guest.
* *Top Assessment* - An assessment in which more than 70% of risks have been answered.
* *(to be continued)*
